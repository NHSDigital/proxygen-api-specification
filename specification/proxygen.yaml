    ## Overview
    Use this API to create and manage resources on NHS England's [API platform](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/api-platform).
    This API is intended for API producers [building healthcare APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/api-platform/building-healthcare-apis).

    You can:
    * register new API definitions
    * publish API specifications
    * manage containers and secrets
    * use your OAS specification to manage API proxies, products and security patterns

    In the future, you will be able to:
    * secure the connection to your target service (back end) with TLS-MA (currently only API Key security is supported)
    * manage preview and live versions of your API's specification

    ## Who can use this API
    This API is only for use by teams building APIs on our API platform. These are predominantly internal NHS England teams.

    ## API status and roadmap
    This API is in [production, beta but internal](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses), meaning:
    * we might make breaking changes, but only if we cannot avoid it, and we will give advance notice
    * it is only available for internal NHS England users

    ## Service level
    This API is a bronze service, meaning it is operational and supported only during business hours (8am to 6pm), Monday to Friday excluding bank holidays.
    
    For more details, see [service levels](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#service-levels).

    ## Technology
    This API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#basic-rest-apis).

    ## Network access
    This API is available on the internet.
    
    For more details see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).

    ## Security and authorisation

    This API supports [application-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#application-restricted-apis) access.
    We are working on [user-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis) access. 

    ### Application-restricted access

    To use this access mode, use the following security pattern:

    - [Application-restricted RESTful API - signed JWT authentication](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/application-restricted-restful-apis-signed-jwt-authentication)

    > The instructions in the above guide are valid, but the implementation details/endpoints differ, as explained below.

    In application-restricted access mode a token is obtained by performing a *client credentials* grant request, with an assertion type of `jwt-bearer` (a signed JWT).

    #### Requirements

    During API registration ([POST /apis](#post-apis)) a **public key** is supplied as a JWKS endpoint.

    A 'machine user' **client** is created with a client ID of `<api_name>-client` and is associated with this public key.

    You use this client ID and the corresponding **private key** to authenticate against our authorisation server and obtain an access token.

    #### Example

    To authenticate as the `hello-world` API machine user, having:

    - a Client ID of `hello-world-client`
    - a private key file
    - The KID of the corresponding public key in the JWKS endpoint: `prod-1`

    ```python
    import uuid
    from time import time

    import requests
    import jwt  # pyjwt library

    REALM_URL = "https://identity.prod.api.platform.nhs.uk/realms/api-producers"
    PRIVATE_KEY_FILE = "./hello-world-client-prod-1.key"  # absolute path
    KID = "prod-1"

    claims = {
        "sub": CLIENT_ID,
        "iss": CLIENT_ID,
        "jti": str(uuid.uuid4()),
        "aud": REALM_URL,
        "exp": int(time()) + 300,
    }

    with open(PRIVATE_KEY_FILE, "r") as f:
        private_key = f.read()

    client_assertion = jwt.encode(
      claims, private_key, algorithm="RS512", headers={'kid': KID}
    )

    token_response = requests.post(
        f"{REALM_URL}/protocol/openid-connect/token",
        data={
            "grant_type": "client_credentials",
            "client_assertion_type": "urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer",
            "client_assertion": client_assertion,
        },
    )

    access_token = token_response.json()["access_token"]

    # Make a request to a protected endpoint
    response = requests.get(
        "https://proxygen.prod.api.platform.nhs.uk/apis/hello-world",
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}"},
    )
    ```

    ### User-restricted access
    Not supported yet. Requires implementation of back-end verification with TLS-MA, which is currently in development.

    ## Environments and testing
    Use the production instance of Proxy Generator API to deploy APIs to all environments.

    The base URL is `https://proxygen.prod.api.platform.nhs.uk`.

    ## Onboarding
    To use this API, you need to [engage with us as an API producer team](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/api-platform/building-healthcare-apis#getting-started).
    
    ## Errors
    We use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request succeeded or not. They are usually in the range:

    * 200 to 299 if it succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs to wait for further action
    * 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client error by your application
    * 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error on our server

    Errors specific to each API are shown in the Endpoints section, under Response. See our [reference guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#http-status-codes) for more on errors.

    ## Concepts and terminology

    ### API

    The top-level concept in Proxy Generator API. Uniquely identified by its kebab-case **API name**.

    > The example API in this documentation is `hello-world`

    An API is typically created with the following **pre-requisite resources**:

    - **Machine client**:
    an OAuth v2 client that can be directly authenticated against, secured by a public-private keypair, with permissions to perform operations against this API. Intended for use in CI/CD pipelines. In our example API the client ID is `hello-world-client`.
    See [Authorisation](#authorisation).
    - **Docker repositories**:
    an API may have one or more associated Docker Repositories. These are typically used to store container images which can be referenced in API instances as *hosted targets*.
    See [GET /apis/{api_name}/docker-token](#get-apis-api_name-docker-token) and the `target` section of the OAS Extension reference.
    - **Keycloak policies and permissions**:
    the ability to act on APIs in Proxy Generator API is controlled by a permission model implemented in a separate authentication and authorisation provider: Keycloak.
    See [Security and authorisation](#security-and-authorisation).
    - **API registry entry**:
    a central registry of each API. The name (for example `hello-world`), short name (for example `hw`) are recorded against a GUID. This allows tracking of APIs through name changes and provides a canonical reference of everything on the API Platform.

    These pre-requisite resources can be updated or enabled/disabled after creation.

    ### Specification

    Each API may have a single OpenAPI specification (v3.0.3) which will be published on the [API catalogue](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue) for reference by API consumers. Refer to the [Writing your API documentation](https://nhsd-confluence.digital.nhs.uk/display/APM/Writing+your+API+documentation) section of the API Platform Confluence space for guidance and best practices.

    #### API specification vs instance specification

    An 'API specification' is distinct from the 'instance specification' which drives the creation of API *instances*.

    | Specification type | Endpoints | Purpose | API catalogue |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | API specification | `GET`, `PUT` `/apis/{api_name}/spec`<br>`GET` `/specs/{api_name}` | Reference for the API (service) as a whole. | Publishes to the API catalogue |
    | Instance specification | `POST` `/apis/{api_name}/environments/{environment}/instances`<br>`GET`, `PUT` `/apis/{api_name}/environments/{environment}/instances/{instance_name}` | Manages an API instance | Does not publish to the API catalogue |

    ### Environments, instances and secrets

    #### Environments

    API instances and secrets are deployed into a specific *environment*. Environments are logically divided into three categories:

    - **Internal path to live** -  `internal-dev`, `internal-dev-sandbox`, `internal-qa-sandbox`, `internal-qa`, `internal-qa-sandbox`, `ref`:
    used by API producers in the development and testing of API proxies.
    - **External ath to live** - `sandbox`, `dev`, `int`:
    used by API consumers in their development of services integrating with the API Platform
    - **Production** - `prod`:
    the live environment.

    > All environments are treated equally with the exception of **production** which requires additional permissions.

    #### Instances

    API *instances* are configured from a supplied **instance-specific OpenAPI specification** (OAS).

    > See [OpenAPI specification constraints and extensions](#openapi-specification-constraints-and-extensions) for the full explanation of the format of this specification.

    An API instance is essentially an API proxy which routes requests to some back-end service. It is deployed in a specific *environment.*

    An API instance has an **instance name** which is derived from the base path of the `servers.0.server.url` property of the OAS.

    > A server URL of `https://internal-dev.api.service.nhs.uk/hello-world-pr-123` would map to the instance name `hello-world-pr-123`

    An API instance may:

    - have one or more **API products** for API consumers to subscribe to
    - implement **rate limiting**
    - send traffic to a **back-end service** or a **hosted container**
    - implement one or more **security patterns** controlling how API clients can authenticate

    ##### Temporary instances

    API resources are limited across the platform and in order to keep deployed resources manageable. API producer teams are allocated a limited number of conncurrently deployed API instances. Once this limit is reached, deployments will fail. In order to keep this manageable for producers, there are a number of batch jobs which delete API instances which are marked as `temporary` periodically, based on their `last_modified` date.

    Examples of when the `temporary` attribute would be appropriate include, but are not limited to:
    - on creation of a pull request (PR) - these instances are often used for automated testing
    - during penetration testing
    - during load testing

    #### Secrets

    Proxy Generator API can be used to store secret values - primarily for use by proxies which are configured for externally hosted target servers. Secrets have a `_type` attribute, which indicate their upstream use. Currently supported secret types are:

    - `apikey` - used when employing API Key security between the API platform and back-end 'target' servers - this will be added to HTTP requests to the target as the value of the 'apikey' header.

    ## OpenAPI specification constraints and extensions

    ### Constraints

    #### OpenAPI version restriction to 3.0.3
    ##### Schema path: `openapi`
    For example: `openapi: 3.0.3`

    #### List of servers must contain a single item
    ##### Schema path: `servers`
    For example:
    ```
    servers:
     - url: 'https://internal-dev-sandbox.api.service.nhs.uk/hello-world'
    ```

    #### Security scheme constraints
    ##### Schema path: `components.securitySchemes`
    A distinct list of security schemes referred to in the [security](https://swagger.io/specification/#security-requirement-object) property of path [Operations Objects](https://swagger.io/specification/#operation-object) defined within this spec.

    For example:
    ```
    securitySchemes:  # limit this to only those used in your API
      nhs-login-p0:
      $ref: https://proxygen.ptl.api.platform.nhs.uk/components/securitySchemes/nhs-login-p0
    nhs-login-p5:
      $ref: https://proxygen.ptl.api.platform.nhs.uk/components/securitySchemes/nhs-login-p5
    nhs-login-p9:
      $ref: https://proxygen.ptl.api.platform.nhs.uk/components/securitySchemes/nhs-login-p9
    nhs-cis2-aal1:
      $ref: https://proxygen.ptl.api.platform.nhs.uk/components/securitySchemes/nhs-cis2-aal1
    nhs-cis2-aal3:
      $ref: https://proxygen.ptl.api.platform.nhs.uk/components/securitySchemes/nhs-cis2-aal3
    app-level0:
      $ref: https://proxygen.ptl.api.platform.nhs.uk/components/securitySchemes/app-level0
    app-level3:
      $ref: https://proxygen.ptl.api.platform.nhs.uk/components/securitySchemes/app-level3
    ```
    Each item references a publically available JSON description object, which is rendered into the final specification document.

    ### Extensions
    #### x-nhsd-apim
    This custom extension to the OpenAPI specification describes the API back-end and is the primary source of information for infrastructure to be deployed by Proxy Generator API.
    See the schema definition below for a full list of available/required attributes.

        > This operation requires the **admin** permission.

        Registers a new API with Proxy Generator API, creating the following pre-requisite resources:

        ### Keycloak policies and permissions
        When `keycloak` is set to `true` (the default) policies and permissions are created in keycloak. These are required to permit access to users and machine clients to perform operations on this API through Proxy Generator API.

        ### Machine client
        When `keycloak` is set to `true` and a `keycloak_client_jwks_resource_url` is provided a machine client is created with client ID `{api-name}-client` with permissions to perform operations on this API through Proxy Generator API. See Security and Authorisation section above.

        ### API Registry entry
        Creates an entry in the API registry unless `api_registry_entry` is set to `false`.

        ### Docker repositories
        The default behaviour is to create an [Elastic Container Registry](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) (ECR) Docker Repository for this API with the same name as the API.

        Set `docker_repositories` to an empty list (`[]`) to skip creation of a repository.

        Create one or more repositories with different names by setting the `docker_repositories` array. Repository names must start with (or be the same as) the API name.

        An API may have an OAS format specification which is (or will be) published on the [API Catalogue](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue).

        Note that this is distinct from the OAS files that drive the generation of API's 'instances' (deployed API proxies). Instance-specific OAS files are typically derived from this specification, but include Proxy Generator API-specific extensions.

      description: |-
        Many Proxy Generator API endpoints accept or return an OpenAPI Specification with some additional constraints and a [specification extension](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/openapi-extensions/).

        Unfortunately the schema for an OAS cannot be represented in another OAS (this Proxy Generator API specification) due to the lack of support for `patternProperties`. This is a **partial/incomplete** representation of that schema, with a specific focus on the Proxy Generator API-specific constraints and extensions.

        Many properties are left 'empty' (eg `type: object`) where they are unmodified. Where there are Proxy Generator API-specific constraints on fields, the original sibling fields are typically included.

        Please also refer to the [OpenAPI Specification version 3.0.3](https://swagger.io/specification/v3/) reference.
